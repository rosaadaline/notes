- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan your time wisely, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your coding endeavors.

First, prioritize your tasks. When you're working on a project, it' s important to determine which tasks are most critical to the success of the project. By focusing on these tasks first, you can ensure that your code is of high quality and meets the requirements of your project timeline. You can use a task management tool, such as Trello or Asana, to help keep track of tasks and their priorities.
